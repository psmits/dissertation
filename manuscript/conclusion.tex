% what does the future look like?
%   we need is a new way of thinking about our questions
%     biological organisation is both real and imagined
%     Gould talked about how we need to think hierarchically
%       his thoughts were wrt clades
%       levels of organisation
%       species selection
%     we need to increase our complexity
%   improving translation of questions into analysis
%     what is ``operationalization''?
%     thinking about data analysis
%     thinking about structured data
