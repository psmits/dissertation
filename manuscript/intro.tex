Species traits are the bridge between evolution and ecology \citep{Mcgill2006,Webber2017}. A trait is an identifiable property of an organism, such as individual body size, while a species trait is some identifiable property of the entire species, such as the average body size or geographic range of a species \citep{Mcgill2006}. A class of species traits called functional traits are those traits which clearly describe a species means of interacting with their environment such as leaf surface area or trophic role \citep{Mcgill2006}. In macroevolutionary studies, analyses are typically focused on a patterns associated with a single single trait or are instead traitless a analysis of diversity and the diversification process \citep{Silvestro2014a,Silvestro2015b,Pires2015a,Rabosky2013,Slater2015c,Hunt2007a,Hunt2006a,Liow2008,Payne2007}. Macroecological studies are frequently concerned with describing the distribution of species and individuals over space or time, such as shifts in community composition along some gradient or axis \citep{Smith2008b,Smith2004,Brown1995,Brown1989,Bush2007,Eronen2009,Fortelius2002,Jernvall2002,Jernvall2004}. My desire with this dissertation is present the types of analyses and results that are possible through a synthesis of both macroevolution and macroecology; my approach is to develop inference devices (i.e. statistical models) to better understand the interactions between the effects of multiple species traits, as well as those of a species' temporal and environmental context, on diversity and differential diversification both in space and time.


\section{Emergent patterns, macroevolution, and macroecology}

An emergent pattern is one that is not observable or predictable from its individual constituent parts. Emergence is ubiquitous in biological systems: cells form a tissue with a complex function, species extinction requires all individual members to die for possibly unrelated reasons, and a species global geographic range is the product of many individual ranges. The history of a species, or set of species, over time is inherently an emergent pattern as the temporal history of a species is not knowable from an instantaneous sample. Macroevolution and macroecology are the studies of emergent patterns in evolutionary and ecological data, respectively \citep{Brown1989,Brown1995,Stanley1979,Stanley1975}. Traditionally, macroevolution is the study of patterns over time while macroecology is concerned with patterns over space, but I find this division overly reductive.

Both macroevolution and macroecology are disciplines concerned with emergent patterns; they both implicitly and explicitly accept a hierarchical perspective on biology as emergence is not possible without different levels of organization, however they are defined. Even if an analysis is concerned with only a single species, the concept of a species is itself an emergent property or label for a collection of populations and individuals which all share a common evolutionary history. While it may be argued that the species label or identity is a non-biological construct or is simply heuristic for understanding the complexity of populations and reproductive isolation, we are still concerned with patterns associated with that construct as well as its intrinsic properties (e.g. extinction, conservation, ecosystem services) \citep{Coyne2004,Jablonski2008a}.

Macroevolution is much more than evolution above the species level \citep{Foote2007b}; this too is overly reductive and assigns too much meaning to a single level of organization rather than embracing the multitudes of possible levels of organisation. Instead, I propose defining macroevolution, \textit{qua} field of study, as the study of emergent evolutionary patterns; this means patterns of speciation/extinction (diversity) as well as trait evolution (disparity), both of which are only observable when considering more than one taxon or when considering the temporal history of one or more taxa. In complement, macroecology is then the study of emergent ecological patterns, which means patterns in spatial distribution or community composition which are observable only when considering more than one taxon or when considering the temporal history of one or more taxa \citep{Brown1989,Brown1995,Smith2008b}. Because taxa inherently respond differently and individually to environmental changes, both biotic and abiotic, macroecological patterns are those due to the similarity in response across individuals \citep{Blois2009}.

Species selection is enshrined as one of the most important patterns in macroevolution \citep{Stanley1975,Stanley1979,Vrba1986,Jablonski2008a,Rabosky2010b,Simpson2016a,Pennell2014}. \citet{Rabosky2010b} portray species selection as resultant phenomenon of the heritability of speciation and extinction rates, a powerful and useful expansion of which phenomenon fall under this category by divorcing levels of organization from the definition and thus avoiding the unproductive species selection versus species sorting debate which has been the cause for a considerable amount of confusion and rhetorical fights \citep{Vrba1984a,Vrba1986,Lloyd1993,Pennell2014}, not the least of which is the adoption of ``sorting'' as an important term for understanding community assembly CITATION. However, I think the definition presented by \citet{Rabosky2010b} misses the mark as an operational definition to inspire and guide future study. Species inherit more than just speciation and extinction rates; they also inherit traits which themselves may be linked to differences in speciation or extinction rates due to their effects on species fitness. Species fitness is a concept that is rarely discussed and difficult to define yet is vitally important to understanding species selection as process \citep{Cooper1984,Palmer2012}. Here I adopt the inclusive definition of fitness presented in \citet{Cooper1984}: species fitness is, minimally, the expected duration of that species. Differences in expected species duration that are associated with species traits are then the product of (species) selection.

A generative definition of species fitness (i.e. relating to speciation rate) is more difficult to develop for a variety or reasons, not the least of which being that the why and how speciation rates can vary both across species and time is not well understood \citep{Rabosky2015c,Rabosky2013e,Coyne2004}. At a minimum, given the earlier definition of fitness wrt duration, species fitness wrt speciation would require the association of differences speciation rate with one or more species traits; this difference in fitness is then the raw material for selection. 

Extinction is a property of, or a phenomenon affecting, species as it requires the death of all organisms within a species which do not have to all occur for the same reason \citep{Simpson2016a}. Extinction is a fundamentally emergent phenomenon that is the ultimate manifestation of selection; it is also central to macroevolutionary studies and the definition of (species) fitness used here \citep{Cooper1984}. Extinction is featured centrally in one of the few ``laws'' in macroevolution and paleobiology: the Law of Constant Extinction \citep{VanValen1973,Liow2011a}. This law states that a species risk of going extinct is independent of that species age \citep{VanValen1973,Liow2011a}, a conclusion reached via analysis of patterns of (higher) taxon survival patterns. The Red Queen hypothesis was proposed as a process that would result in the observation underlying the Law of Constant Extinction \citep{VanValen1973}, though it has obviously grown to have a life of its own \citep{Liow2011a}.

The functional composition of a community or species pool is a property of that unit; observing a single species at a locality does not reveal the functional composition of the community in which it interacts. \uppercase{really need to come back to this and fix it}

The composition of a community or species pool in terms of functional groups is an ecological exercise. Comparing the distribution of functional groups across communities or species pools is then a macroecological exercise. 

In paleobiology, functional groups of marine invertebrates are defined according to a three dimensional classification scheme called an ``ecocube'' \citep{Bush2007,Bambach2007}.

%       this is under-appreciated

% inference devices
An inference device is a theoretical tool for improving our knowledge by processing new information and observations \citep{McElreath2016} CITATION; this device has initial conditions describing what we know (e.g. nothing), mechanisms for updating this knowledge to reflect new information, and can then produce an updated ``picture'' that better represents our current knowledge as well as the uncertainty surrounding this knowledge. Each inference device has a specific and narrow purpose and functionality \citep{McElreath2016} CITATION; unless the mechanisms are similar, a device for processing the rate of imperfections in the manufacturing of widgets cannot process the queuing times of callers to a help line.  

We can think of (Bayesian statistical) models as inference devices because they fulfill the requirements described above: initial conditions, updating mechanism, and output as updated knowledge along with the uncertainty surrounding that knowledge \citep{McElreath2016} JAYNES. Similarily, we can think of the well known battery of statistical tests CITATION \uppercase{Biometry} as re-usable inference devices with very narrow utility.


Structure occurs naturally in the collection of data. A simple example would be the results of drug trials from multiple hospitals; it is possible to consider these results in aggregate by ignoring the effect of hospital, or these results can be considered individually by hospital. The goal in the analysis of structured data through hierarchical or multi-level models is to integrate this structure into the analysis. For biological data, a simple example would be studying the traits of individuals within a single species that are collected from multiple locations. For many reasons, we might expect that individuals from the same location are more similar to each other than to individuals from other locations. But incorporating this reality into the analysis, both estimates and predictions are improved \citep{Gelman2007,Gelman2013d,McElreath2016}.

I emphasize model-based approaches to analysis because a common language is necessary for clear, coherent, and translatable results. Some of the greatest limits to paleobiological, macroevolutionary, and macroecological study are a lack of strong, mechanistic predictive theories that can be expressed mathematically. Some of the greatest strides in macroevolutionary and macroecological studies wrt to advancing theory disputes have come from translating verbal theory to mathematical and statistical models \citep{Hunt2006a,Hunt2007,Shipley2006}. The reality of the complexity underlying biological process is rarely integrated into paleobiological analyses of macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns and processes. A move to a model-forward approach to paleobiology, heavily steeped in evolutionary and ecological theory, would be beneficial for paleobiology as well as the studies of macroevolution and macroecology. Too often paleobiologists malign their position as ignored by neontologists when discussing macroevolution and macroecology, without a concerted effort to utilize the same language when both phrasing questions and developing analytical tools (i.e. statistical models) then this worry and resentment is all but preordained. The simplest and fastest way to begin an actual dialogue is by translating verbal macroevolutionary and macroecological theories from paleobiology into statistical models that are readable by all researchers.

Two of the most important analytical approaches at the core of macroevolutionary study are the birth-death process for diversification \citep{Raup1973,Raup1985,Nee1992,Nee1994a,Nee2001,Nee2006b,Stadler2013b}, and the random walk heuristic for trait evolution \citep{Raup1974a,Felsenstein1985b,Bookstein1987b,Gingerich1993,Roopnarine2001a,Roopnarine2003b,Roopnarine1999,Sheets2001,Hunt2006a,Hunt2007a}. Discrete-state Markov processes also feature when modeling the evolution of discrete traits and biogeography CITATIONS.

All three of the studies covered by this dissertation make use of some variant to the birth-death process. The first two studies are analyses of extinction, which is a pure-death processes. The third study utilizes a discrete-time birth-death process to model species presence in a species pool.

Similar cores are harder to identify for macroecology as a whole, so here I identify species distribution models as a power framework for understading the distribution of species, both do to environmental factors \citep{Elith2009} and species traits \citep{Shipley2006}. Both of these approaches attempt to operationalize the multitude of processes which result in the distribution of one or more species in both space and time. The maximum entropy theory of community assembly view community assembly as an ecological sorting process where traits mediate the effects of environmental filters \citep{Shipley2006,Warton2015a}; also called ``community assembly via trait selection'' (CATS). Species distribution models or SDMs are a class of models which relate species geographic presence-absence distribution to the environmental factors which characterize those apperances \citep{Elith2009,Austin2006,Phillips2006a}. SDMs are a means of operationalizing a species' ``realized niche'' CITATION. These approaches can be united in a single fourth-corner model \citep{Warton2015a,Brown2014c}. The fourth-corner problem is an old problem in community ecology originating in the multivariate analysis literature: assuming species distribution is the result of functional traits interacting with environmental factors, how do we estimate which interactions are important and their relative strengths \citep{Legendre1997,Dray2008}? Advances in SDMs, along with advances surrounding CATs regression \citep{Renner2013}, have made this very possible and interpretable \citep{Brown2014c,Jamil2013,Pollock2012,Pollock2015}.

The third study in this dissertation makes extensive use of the macroecological framework by casting the fourth-corner problem into an additional dimension: time. The combination of clear macroecological theory and modelling approaches with the birth-death process at core of diversification into a single unified model in order to understand how species pool functional composition changes over time is a powerful bridge between macroecology and macroevolution.



\section{Study summaries}  % section needs expanding/restructuring

Each of the chapters that make up this dissertation feature structured data and a hierarchical model describing this structure. The first two chapters have a decidedly macroevolutionary bent while the third has a macroecological bent. However, all three are informed by both evolution and ecology; after all, the focus is of all studies is the relationship between functional traits to emergent patterns.




The first chapter is an analysis of North American mammal species duration wrt multiple species traits, origination cohort, and shared evolutionary history (i.e. phylogeny). All of these factors are emergent properties of a species, with origination cohort and shared evolutionary history also being data structuring factors. Additionally, the possibility of species age affecting extinction risk is also considered as a possible test of the Law of Constant Extinction \citep{VanValen1973}. This analysis is also concerned with the long standing ``survival of the unspecialized'' hypothesis wrt species duration/extinction risk \citep{Simpson1944}.

The second chapter is an analysis of post-Cambrian brachiopod genus duration wrt multiple species traits and origination cohort. As with the first chapter, all of these factors are emergent properties of species, and origination cohort is used as a structuring factor. Similarly, the possibility of age-dependent extinction is allowed. What distinguishes this study from the first is the additional focus on the relationship between the selective importance of these emergent factors and the higher-level average fitness of an origination cohort.

The third chapter is an analysis of the functional composition of the North American mammal regional species pool over time with the goal of understanding when are specific ecotypes enriched or depleted and how these patterns may be associated with species' environmental context. The structuring factors in this analysis are both the mammal ecotypes and the temporal units of the discrete time-series describing species presence and absence in the regional species pool. This analysis presents a multi-level model where the properties of the structuring factor (e.g. environmental context) are included as covariates affecting the emergent ecotype-specific pattern.
