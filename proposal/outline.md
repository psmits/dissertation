- Introduction
    - theoretical framework
        - evolutionary macroecology / macroevolution
        - life history/natural history traits
        - species/hierarchical selection

- Chapter 1
    - differential survivorship in brachiopods
        - Australia
        - Permian
        - life history traits: substrate, affix, environment
        - site occurence/range size information
        - survivorship analysis to look for what best explains differential
          extinction risk
        - relation to change from ice to hot during Permian
            - Clapham's community structure work

- Chapter 2
    - Evolution of correlation of life history traits in brachiopods
        - Australia
        - Permian
        - life history traits: substrate, affix, environment
        - correlation structure between life history traits
            - change over time
        - strength of selection
        - relation to change from ice to hot during Permian
            - Clapham's community structure work

- Chapter 3


- Chapter 4
    - cosmopolitan and proviscialism dynamics of North American terrestrial
      mammals across the Cenozoic
        - North America
        - Cenozoic
        - terrestrial mammals
        - life history traits: diet, locomotor/life history category
        - correlation with d18O curve
        - changes in community connectedness levels over time
            - the four measures of Sidor2013
            - locality coverage from Jervall2004

- Conclusion
