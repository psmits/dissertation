- Introduction
   - theoretical framework
       - evolutionary paleoecology
          - the evolutionary consequences of ecological properties, roles and
            strategies at the individual, population, community and species
            levels.
             - Kitchell1985a
          - trait that directly relates to the life history of an organism 
             - doesn't matter at what level the trait is expressed
          - how do we know if an ecological trait has any consequences?
             - mechanism linking ecological trait to origination/extinction or
               fitness
                - Kichell1990,Allmon1994
       - macroevolution
          - long term patterns in species and extinction
             - the question is about how to determine the process behind the
                  pattern
             - biology of extinction
                - why do some organisms go extinct and others don't?
                   - Kitchell1990
                - community structure
                   - what drives community similarity and divergence?
                      - mammals Jernvall2002,Jernvall2004
             - define fitness
                - expected time till extinction
                   - Cooper1984
                - survival estimate of a lineage
                   - Palmer2012
                - what is the relationship between origination/extinction and
                  fitness
          - aggregate traits versus emergent traits
              - effect macroevolution
                - upward causation
              - species selection
                - downward causation
              - what is the reducibility of a trait that is expressed at the
                organismal level but constant across all individuals?
                 - this seems to be the point at which there is major contention
                   in the literature 
          - caveats
             - macroevolution != species selection
             - the level of expression is most important
       - Price Equation
          - relationship between trait covariance and fitness
             - evolutionary change between two populations
             - by extension, selection
             - Price1970,Price1972
             - Rice2004,Rice2008
             - Rice1995
             - Frank2012,Frank2012b
      - VanValen's Law of Constant Extinction
          - hazard function is constant 
             - VanValen1973
          - mechanism
             - Red Queen Hypothesis
             - VanValen1973,Liow2011a
          -  rampant misinterpretation because of false dichotomy
             - Cour Jester Barnosky2001a
          - Quental2013
          - VanValen1985
            - Kitchell1991
      - life history/natural history traits
          - definition
              - trait reducible expressed at the organismal level but that is
                constant across all individuals
                  - e.g. diet, locomotion, affixing strategy
                  - Jablonski1983,Jablonski2006a,Jablonski2008
              - intersection of effect and species-selection
              - evolutionary paleoecology sensu Kitchell1985a
          - does ETE vary between groups based on life history traits?
              - Kitchell1990,Marzluff1991
