- Introduction
    - theoretical framework
        - evolutionary paleoecoloyg: the evolutionary consequences of ecological
          properties, roles, and strategies at the individual, population,
          community, and species levels.
            - linkage between a species' ecology and its macroevolutionary
              history
            - evolutionary paleoecology examines the interaction between object
              and property, specifically the evolutionary consequences of
              ecological properties
            - Kitchell1985a
            - this is pretty fundamental
        - evolutionary macroecology / macroevolution
            - biology of extinction (speciation)
                - why do some organisms go extinct and others don't?
            - community structure
                - what drives community similarity and divergence?
            - Kitchell1985a,Hoffman1984,Carr1980,Allmon1994
        - species/hierarchical selection
            - Jablonski2007,Jablonski2008,Jablonksi2000a,Jablonksi2008b,Jablonski2008c
            - Gilinsky1987
            - Rice1995
            - Frank2012
        - Red Queen
        - life history/natural history traits
            - expected time to extinction as measure of "fitness"
                - differential survivorship based on more "fit" traits 
                - Cooper1984
            - Jablonski1983
            - Sepkoski1991

- Chapter 1
    - differential survivorship in brachiopods
        - Australia
        - Permian
        - life history traits: substrate, affix, environment
        - site occurence/range size information
        - survivorship analysis to look for what best explains differential
          extinction risk
            - interval data
            - what best models time-event?
        - relation to change from ice to hot during Permian
            - Clapham's community structure work

- Chapter 2
    - Evolution of correlation of life history traits in brachiopods
        - Australia
        - Permian
        - life history traits: substrate, affix, environment
        - correlation structure between life history traits
            - change over time
        - strength of selection
        - relation to change from ice to hot during Permian
            - Clapham's community structure work

- Chapter 3


- Chapter 4
    - cosmopolitan and proviscialism dynamics of North American terrestrial
      mammals across the Cenozoic
        - North America
        - Cenozoic
        - terrestrial mammals
        - life history traits: diet, locomotor/life history category
