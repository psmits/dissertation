- Introduction
    - theoretical framework
        - fundamentals
            - recast evolutionary palecology sensu Kitchell1985a in light of
              modern concepts of macroevolution Jablonski2008a
                - pay heed to Allmon1994 taxic evolutionary paleoecology for
                  resolving the punq eq concern
            - fitness on macroevolutionary scales using Cooper1984 definition of fitness
                - expected time till extinction
            - biology of macroevolution
                - relation to life history characters
                    - in terms of effect and species selection
                    - fundamental aspect evolutionary paleoecology
                - community dynamics, fitness
        - evolutionary paleoecology: the evolutionary consequences of ecological
          properties, roles, and strategies at the individual, population,
          community, and species levels.
            - Kitchell1985a
            - evolutionary paleoecology examines the interaction between object
              and property, specifically the evolutionary consequences of
              ecological properties
            - linkage between a species' ecology and its macroevolutionary
              history as defined by differential
                - origination (lambda) / extinction (mu)
                - fitness (E[t_ext])
                    - expected time till extinction
                    - Cooper1984
                    - how to define fitness in terms of lambda and mu?
                        - mu is the hazard ratio (failure rate)
                        - failure rate is defined as deaths per time
            - taxic evolutionary paleoecology Allmon 1994
                - reconcile punc eq with evolutionary paleoecology
                    - see Gene's work for determining prevelance of this
                    - macroevolution hand out for more information
                - focus on how ecology effects the mechanisms of speciation
                    - origination, extinction
                    - what about fitness? (ETE) Cooper1984
            - biology of extinction (speciation)
                - why do some organisms go extinct and others don't?
                - Kitchell1990
            - community structure
                - what drives community similarity and divergence?
                    - mammals Jernvall2002,Jernvall2004
                - Kitchell1985a
            - Hoffman1984,Carr1980
        - macroevolution
            - defined frequently as long term lambda/mu
                - no discussion of fitness
                    - except see Kitchell1985a,Kitchell1990
                - what is relationship between fitness and lambda/mu?
            - effect
                - selection on an organismal trait effects macroevolutionary
                  process
                    - upward causation sensu Jablonski2008a
                - Vrba1983
                - selection on aggregate traits sensu Jablonski2008a
                    - e.g. distribution/mean body size
            - species (hierarchical) selection
                - selection on traits not reducible to the organismal level
                    - emergent traits sensu Jablonski2008a
                    - e.g. geographic range, substrate affinity
                    - Jablonski2007,Jablonski2008b,Gilinsky1987
                - important
                    - macroevolution != species selection
                        - Vrba1983
                    - species selection != punctuated equilibrium
                        - Jablonski2008a
                - Price Equation
                    - \(\bar{w} \Delta \bar{z} = Cov(w, z) + E(w \Delta z)\)
                    - or \(\Delta \bar{z} = \frac{Cov(w, z)}{\bar{w}} + \frac{E(w \Delta z)}{\bar{w}}\)
                    - relationship between trait covariance and fitness
                        - evolutionary change between two populations
