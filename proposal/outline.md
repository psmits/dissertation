- Introduction
    - theoretical framework
        - evolutionary paleoecology
            - the evolutionary consequences of ecological properties, roles and
              strategies at the individual, population, community and species
              levels.
                - Kitchell1985a
            - trait that directly relates to the life history of an organism 
                - doesn't matter at what level the trait is expressed
            - how do we know if an ecological trait has any consequences?
                - mechanism linking ecological trait to origination/extinction or
                  fitness
                    - Kichell1990,Allmon1994
         - macroevolution
             - long term patterns in species and extinction
                 - the question is about how to determine the process behind the
                    pattern
                 - biology of extinction
                     - why do some organisms go extinct and others don't?
                         - Kitchell1990
                     - community structure
                         - what drives community similarity and divergence?
                             - mammals Jernvall2002,Jernvall2004
                 - define fitness
                     - expected time till extinction
                         - Cooper1984
                     - survival estimate of a lineage
                         - Palmer2012
                     - what is the relationship between origination/extinction and
                       fitness
             - aggregate traits versus emergent traits
                 - effect macroevolution
                     - upward causation
                 - species selection
                     - downward causation
                 - reducibility of trait
                     - what is important is the level of expression of the trait
                     - this is a major contention with aggregate traits
                          - what level is the mean of an organismal trait?
                          - Jablonski2008
                     - what is the reducibility of a trait that is expressed at the
                       organismal level but constant across all individuals?
                     - this seems to be the point at which there is major contention
                       in the literature 
                     - example of not understanding Grantham1995
             - caveats
                 - macroevolution != species selection
         - Price Equation
             - relationship between trait covariance and fitness
                 - evolutionary change between two populations
                 - by extension, selection
