\section{Introduction and theoretical framework}

\subsection{Evolutionary paleoecology}
Evolutionary paleoecology is defined as the study of the effects of ecological traits and factors on differential rate dynamics, particularly rates of faunal turnover and diversification \citep{Kitchell1985a}.
Ecological traits and factors are any and all traits expressed by a taxon, at any level, that are involved with biotic--biotic or biotic--abiotic interactions. These interactions are between the taxon and a factor, which as stated may be either biotic or abiotic.
Diversification is the difference between origination and extinction, and is thus the net product of pattern of macroevolution.
The study of evolutionary paleoecology is then the link between interactions and macroevolution. Namely, it is the study of the ecological processes that may or may not generate the patterns of macroevolution.
As a corrolary to \citet{Kitchell1985a}'s definition, \citet{Allmon1994} states that in order to correctly link ecological processes to macroevolution, one must focus on the specific traits and factors that affect the speciation process. Tacitly included in this is the study of the biology of extinction \citep{Kitchell1990}. % this probably needs more to be convincing

It is under this framework that I purpose to study
% change in range of biotic interactions
% extinction selectivity

% why each data set is very well suited for each one?
I will be comparing extinction selectivity in two very distantly related and biotically very different groups: mammals and brachiopods. Both of these groups are considered to have very good fossil records able to reflect massive long term evolutionary patterns \citep{Mark1977}.

\subsection{Paleobiological theory}
% definition

% metonymy

Extinction, away from mass extinctions, is non-random \citep{Jablonski1986}. Additionally, times of ``background extinction'' represent the vast majority of geological time compared to periods of ``mass extinction.''

Paleobiology is the study of life over time and in particular the processes that generate the observed patterns in diversity and disparity and how these may have changed.  % look up in the foote book
Intimately related to this is the concept of macroevolution. Macroevolution, \textit{sensu stricto}, is the pattern of speciation and extinction dynamics over time \citep{Jablonski2008a}. The study of macroevolution, thus, is the method by which the processes underlying these patterns are delineated. The term origination is frequently used in place of speciation because it is considered impossible to observe speciation in the fossil record and instead we only observe the sudden appearance of a new taxon \citep{Coyne2004}.

Macroevolution, \textit{sensu lato}, is both phyletic and anagenetic evolutionary dynamics \citep{Foote2007b}. Phyletic means speciation/extinction dynamics and anagenetic means within lineage disparity dynamics. This concept has also been termed the tempo and mode of evolution \citep{Simpson1944}. This broader definition more closely links paleobiology and macroevolution.

In contrast to macroevolution is microevolution \citep{Simpson1944,Foote2007b} which is defined strictly as change in allele frequency in a population from one generation to the next. A weaker definition is that microevolution is change below the species level \citep{Foote2007b} though there is no qualifier on what this change is defined as. It is important to note that changes in allele frequency affect phenotype frequency and expression.

% why this definition isn't as useful
%   conflation of two different patterns
%   makes the word too broad
%   this is macroevolution as metaphor

Of concern with the broader definition of macroevolution is that this concept subsumes all aspects of anagenetic change. The difference between microevolution versus macrevolution is unclear. Interestingly, the link between macroevolution \textit{sensu lato} and Simpson's tempo and mode of evolution is that Simpson's statement assigns no hierarchical level to these patterns. The pervasiveness of the use of macroevolution \textit{sensu lato} then is because this usage is metaphoric and explicitly because it is not the actual definition of macroevolution.

Traits are properties that are expressed at some level. Emergent traits are defined as traits that are not reducible to a lower level \citep{Jablonski2008a}OTHER CITATIONS. An emergent trait is thus a relative concept which must be defined in relation to a specific organizational level (e.g. species, organism, etc.). In paleobiology, emergent traits are frequently defined as those properties not reducible to the organismal level. If a trait is not reducible, it is then considered species, or genus, level traits.

Range size is continually cited as an emergent, species-level trait CITATIONS. 

The studies I am and will be undertaking are related to organismal traits such as dietary category and substrate affinity. Each of these traits can be considered to be related to the emergence of range-size. However, the relative importance of these different traits and their interactions in terms of fitness and extinction risk SOMETHING


\section{Cosmopolitan and endemic mammal dynamics of Cenozoic mammals}

\textit{Questions:} Do different continental populations of terrestrial mammals demonstrate different patterns of community similarity and change over the Cenozoic? Are these patterns related to ecological characters, such as dietary category and locomotor category? Are these patterns related to changes in global temperature?

\textit{Hypotheses and Predictions:}
During the Cenozoic, there is a general global shift from closed, forested habitats to open, savanna habitats. Because of this, it is reasonable to expect a relative decrease in arboreal taxa as well as a relative decrease in terrestrial taxa. Additionally, an increased in the relative endemism of arboreal taxa over time and an decrease in the relative endemism of terrestrial taxa might accompany this. However, this expected shift in distribution of taxa according to locomotor category is not necessarily accompanied by broad shifts in distribution of (coarse) dietary categories.

However, the timing of this shift is different between continents \citep{Stromberg2005,Stromberg2013}, meaning that the patterns reflecting this environmental shift may be globally non-uniform.

Majority of research focused on North America

europe retains similar balance in trophic categories over at least Neogene RAIA JERNVALL 

The record of the South American mammalian fauna appears to reflect two distinct biotic provinces between the North and the South of the continent \citep{Macfadden1997,Macfadden2006,Flynn1998a,Patterson1968}. Beacuse of this, South America is predicted to have a very different record of biogeographic connectedness than either North America or Europe, specifically in terms of patterns of endemism. Speifically, it might be expected that would be a high or progressively increasing degree of endemism along with low connectivity. but increase in land-dwelling herbiovres relative to arboreal (at least in the south).

\textit{Reasoning:}

\textit{Proposed research:}
Using methods first proposed by \citet{Sidor2013} and \citet{Vilhena2013}.

Compare generic results to specific results because that is what \citet{Jernvall2002} and \citet{Jernvall2004} did and what \citet{Tomiya2013} did not.


\section{Fitness and extinction risk related to ecology in Cenozoic mammals}

\textit{Questions:} How do ecological characters, such as dietary category and locomotor category, affect extinction risk in mammals? Does this relationship change over time? Is anyone trait the best predictor of extinction risk, or do multiple traits together or interacting better explain extinction?

\textit{Hypotheses and Predictions:} 

During periods of background extinction we expect that extinction events are non-random with respect to biology \citep{Jablonski1986}. Additionally, survival can be considered the ultimate measure of fitness or evolution success \citep{Cooper1984,Palmer2012} because ultimately a long-term successful lineage is not one that speciated greatly but one that never went extinct \citep{Palmer2012}.

In mammals, three of the arguably most important ecological traits are dietary category, locomotor category, and body size CITATIONS. Additionally, each of these traits are imporant in determing the emergent species level property of range size.

While diet and locomotor categories are known to evolve in context amongst terrestrial mammals, they are not the same trait and thus it is very possible that there is not necessarily any direct causal connection between the evolution of these traits. However, it may be quite possible that there is a correlation between them. This is similar, also, with correlations between either of these traits and body size.


Difference between survivorship/hazard rate and (bin) rate

As discubsed above, as the Cenozoic progressed on all Continents there was a shift from closed habitat to more open habitat. In the intermediate, one would expect some degree of patchiness in the landscape. Expectedly, there would be a increase followed by a decrease in both speciation rate and extinction rate, with the peak being during the intermediate period.

According to \citet{Price2012}, herbivores and carnivores should have a greater diversification rate than omnivores. This analysis was global in scope, and purely extant taxa in a phylogenetic comparative method context. If this is still the case for the survival analysis, that will be very interesting.


Depending on the continent, body size has been demonstrated to play either some or no roll in extinction selectivity during the Neogene \citep{Tomiya2013,Liow2008,Liow2009}. By expanding to include a third continent, South America, I hope to elucidate how differences in constituent taxa at a continental level might affect body size mediated extinction risk. Additionally, I will be using alternative methods to better understand the dynamics governing trait based extinction probability.

Given \citep{Jernvall2002}, it might be expected that the pattern for all mammals will be most similar to the pattern from (common) herbivores. However, I am unsure if this is a reasonable prediction.

Compare generic results to specific results because that is what \citet{Jernvall2002} and \citet{Jernvall2004} did and what \citet{Tomiya2013} did not.

\section{Extinction risk related to traits affecting habitat selection in Permian brachiopods}

\textit{Questions:} How do traits directly related habitat selection and range size relate to extinction risk? Are certain traits more explanatory of extinction risk than others? Does changing environmental and substrate availability affect trait-based extinction risk?

\textit{Hypotheses and Predictions:}
progressive loss of epicontinental seas: decrease in fitness (for proportion) of that trait

shift relative proportion of pedunculate/reclining/cementing taxa: almost random \citep{Clapham2007} in terms of any ``trend.'' 

substrate preference: NEED TO CHECK LITERATURE

according to \citet{Alexander1977}, endemic unattached/reclining taxa have longer durations than all other affixing strategies of other endemic taxa. on the other hand, cosmopolitan pedunculate and cementing taxa have longer durations than unattached/reclining taxa. in terms of regional scales, it will be necessary to correct for relative abundance to actally measure survivability/fitness.
