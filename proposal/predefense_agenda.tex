\section{Comments on current proposal draft}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Michael's concerns
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Trait assignments
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Current substrate and habitat assignments are preliminary
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Review literature for improved site/formation descriptions
              \item Increase assignment resolution
            \end{itemize}
          \item Currently, there are no reef(-like) assignments for environments in the PBDB data
        \end{itemize}
      \item Scaling up of traits
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Proposal has shifted from testing ``emergence'' directly
          \item Precise language in proposal and talk necessary
        \end{itemize}
      \item Preliminary results
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Very poor/rough right censoring criterion
          \item To be improved with more conservative ``study end'' date
          \item LAD uncertainty via interval censoring
          \item No climatic context
        \end{itemize}
      \item Regional/local climate proxies instead of purely global
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Mammals: unknown, must research
          \item Brachiopods: well resolved glacial patterns for Australia thanks to Tracy Frank and Christopher Fielding
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Future concerns and directions}
\subsection{Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Preliminary results
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Improve censoring (combination right, left and interval)
      \item More conservative ``thresholds'' near boundaries
      \item Execute phylogenetic measures for community connectedness
    \end{itemize}
  \item Survival analysis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In context of phylogeny? Some work has been done recently to include pedigrees and such. 
      \item Develop (new) PCM method (with Rick)?
      \item Survival analysis is similar to a regression problem, though likelihood is calculated differently to allow for different censoring methods.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Brachiopods
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Assign affixing strategies
      \item Improve on current coarse assignments
      \item Site/formation descriptions from literature
      \item Include Chinese record for latitudinal comparison
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Latitude/temperature has not been found to limit dispersal/range in modern Brachiopods
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Mammals
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Hind's Fund: obtained
      \item South American mammal taxonomy congruence between FMNH and AMNH
      \item Review catalogue information from FMNH collection
      \item Body size from literature search
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conferences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Preliminary brachiopod results at Evolution 2014
  \item Simulation of effects of differential preservation on survival at GSA 2014
\end{itemize}
