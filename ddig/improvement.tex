The goal of the proposed research

My research (PDS) straddles the interests of both my advisor, Dr. Kenneth Angielzcyk, and my co-advisor, Dr. Michael Foote. Dr. Angielzcyk's research is focused on synapsids, a group of mammal-relatives, during the Permian and at the Permian--Triassic mass extinction. Dr. Foote's research is primarily focused on long-term evolutionary and spatial patterns of marine invertebrates. While I work on both spatio-temporal dynamics and extinction risk, my dissertation is independent from either of them in that it focuses on Cenozoic mammals and in the analytical framework I am applying. Because of this, my research is not an extension of any the existing projects of either of my advisors and I have not received fiscal support from either of them.
