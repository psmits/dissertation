This DDIG research involves traveling to museums in Argentina and measuring specimens. I (PDS) will then spend two weeks in the vertebrate paleontology collections at both the Museo Argentino de Ciencas Naturales in Buneos Aires and Museo de La Plata in nearby La Plata. Both of these museums house large collections of fossil Cenozoic mammals from which I do not have body mass estimates.

I will fly into Buenos Aires, Argentina. There, I will spend one week visiting the Museo Argentino de Ciencas Naturales to measure specimens. The second week I will travel by bus to the nearby city of La Plata. While staying in La Plata, I will be visiting the collections at the Museo de La Plata. 

In the second year, I am requesting funds to present some of my results at the Evolution Meeting held in Austin, Texas in June 2016. I am also requesting funds to present more of my results at the Geological Society of America meeting in Seattle, Washington in October 2016.

All flight and hotel cost estimates were obtained through Kayak.com. Transportation cost estimates were obtained through TripAdvisor.com.


F) Participant Support Costs: \$0

G) Other Direct Costs:

1) Materials and Supplies

\begin{tabular}[H]{l r}
  Budget Item & Item Total \\
  \hline
  Mitutoyo 12-inch Calipers 500-196-20 & \$160.00 (Year 1) \\
  4TB external hard drive & \$200.00 (Year 1) \\
  \textbf{Total} & \$360.00 \\
  \textbf{Requested from NSF} & \$360.00
\end{tabular}

Mitutoyo calipers are standard tools for obtaining exact measurements and are essential for my data collection. Currently, I am using a pair on departmental loan however these are of limited access because they are shared between many students. 

External hard drive is for improving the backup, security, and preservation of all data collected and used in this analysis.

H) Total Direct Costs: \$5860.00 (\$3360.00 + \$2500.00)

I) Total Indirect Costs: \$3399.00 (\$1949.00 + \$1450.00)

Indirect cost rate is 58\% (of Modified Direct Cost = Total Cost less than Tuition) for the entire project period, per the indirect cost rate agreement dated 01/18/2014 between the University of Chicago and its cognizant federal agency, the National Science Foundation.


J) Total Direct and Indirect Costs: \$9259.00 (\$5860.00 + \$3399.00)

K) Residual Funds: \$0

L) Amount of this Request: \$9259.00
