      \item presented at GSA 2015

% biggest criticism was that i completely ignored effect of sampling
%   i measure sampling as the simple gap statistic
%   use it as a covariate of duration
%   this is the estimate the biasing effect of sampling
%     NOT correct duration for sampling
%     record is too coarse for a lot of methods
%     just a different way of doing it
%       i would use the new Wang approach for sampling instead of simple CLS type model
% effect of sampling probability on duration
%   (imupted) gap statistic
%   some limit pushing, but use beta regression to help estimate

% results
%   table and over-all probabilities 
%   environmental preference
%   change over time
%   covariance matrix


\section{Taxon occurrence as a function of both emergent biological traits and its environmental context}

% Theoretical underpinning
%   change in regional species pool over time
%   intersection of macroecology and macroevolution

% modified fourth-corner type problem
%   presence_{i,t} | individual-level_{i,t}, group-level_{t} observation_{t}
%   effects of covariates varies with t
%   instead of group-level covariates included as part of multi-level model
%   keeping in mind group-level covariates depend on t

% after \citep{Smits2015}
%   decrease in extinction risk over time
%     notice the pattern at the paleogene-neogene boundary
%   higher extinction risk in arboreal taxa
%     strong effect
%     what is variation in effect? paleogene vs neogene
%       is the transition/neogene effect so strong to appear constant?
%     driven by the environmental change?

% Vallesian crisis in Europe
%   faunal shift at Paleogene-Neogene boundary
%   do we see this in NA in terms of ecotypes?
