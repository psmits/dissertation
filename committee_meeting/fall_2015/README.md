proto agenda
------------

- since last meeting
  - Evolution
  - GSA
  - chapter 1/PNAS paper
  - submitted chapter 2/brachiopod survival
    - still in review (~2 months!?)
  - ken and i submitted a side project; rejected but we're working on that
  - side project with stuart on regional species naming rates in bivalves
- current projects
  - regional patterns in the diversification of Paleozoic brachiopods
    - hierarchical Bayesian hidden Markov model
    - four latitudinal bands
      - change to 8 if split along meridian?
      - no biological meaning; lack of other options (e.g. plates)
    - slow JAGS code; geomips isn't enough
      - i've had a lot of trouble connecting to the FMNH server (can't)
    - major assumptions are that genera can occur in any geographic bin and
      occur completely independently
      - can lead to some taxa existing longer than in actuality
      - possibly controlled for by sampling rate through time?
      - which further assumes all times and places are similar (to a degree) in
        terms of all generating parameters (phi, gamma, p)
    - relaxing this assumption is extremely parameter intensive
  - changes in Cenozoic mammal ecotype composition 
    - hierarchical Bayesian multi-logit model
      - by time bin (order not explicitly modeled...yet...?)
    - follow up to PNAS paper
      - key is arboreality, but i want to see interaction with diet
      - wasn't dealt with at all in my PNAS paper
    - includes phylogenetic effect
      - three independent effects (assume BM)
        - k = 1, ..., K - 1 vs k = K
      - see softmax parameterization
    - is body size worth including as a predictor?
      - idea would be to help further control for similarity among taxa
- time till completion
  - i'm out of fellowship in 2017
  - i have to TA this year (expecting spring, but i've got nothing lined up?)
  - i have to TA next year
    - assuming no fellowship (FMNH? but i'm never there)
    - am i am allowed to teach the teaching class again?
  - advice: finish only once i've got a post-doc set up
- post-doc opportunities
  - what do i want out of a postdoc?
    - new methods? diff eqs, networks, phylogenetic inference
    - new topic? levels of selection, phylogenetic inference
    - other gaps in knowledge? phylogenetic inference
  - people?
    - berkeley: charles marshall / john huelsenbeck / miller fellowship
  - for personal reasons, any options in chicago?
