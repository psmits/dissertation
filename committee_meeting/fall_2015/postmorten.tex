% general overview
%   systematic run through of past, present, future

% past projects
%   2 chapters, (but 4 chapter dissertation)
%   1 published
%   1 submitted
%     need to get comments from other committee members, as they've never seen it

% current projects
%   brachiopods
%     very at risk of unimportance/irrelevancy
%       methods are not a substitute for new ideas
%       LDG is a bog and not worth my time
%       instead focus more on geosse style how taxa get into regions/assembly
%     new taxonomic group?
%     new temporal range (shorter, Cenozoic)?
%     need more meaningful geographic units
%       going all the way back to proposal
%     methods are fine, but question and mostly the system need rethinking
%       why? what hypotheses to do i have?
%   mammals
%     break up ground dwelling: plantigrade, digitigrade, unguligrade
%       help deal with ``ground dwelling'' problem
%     vegetation/envrionment reconstructions for north america
%       have conversation directly with Alroy 2000 (climate no effect on mammal evolution, but what about plant communities)
%       is everything just driven by environment type?
%     need to figure out how to better phrase certain parameter names
%     need to figure out a better way of doing or presenting effect of dietary category covariate
%     climate 
%       use (interquartile) range in addition to mean?
%       other isotope curves --> Mg-Ca curves which might behave better/reflect actual temp
%       isotope curves are global. if i can get something environmental i have improved on this limitation
%     good call for AmNat? need to keep speaking evolutionary biology.


% future
%   estimated spring/summer 2017 finish time
%   how can/should i market myself?
%     evolutionary biologist/biology departments
%     outside change paleobiologist
%     issues surrounding always having to prove myself in either
%     \uppercase{questions person not analysis person}
%       don't be a hired gun
%       lead with questions, context, why, hypotheses and \uppercase{never} the analysis
%     build a research program/identity. currently my identity is too quixotic and erratic.
%   need to get list of potential post-doc people by spring quarter/next committee meeting
%     a short list was developed with Slater and Foote
%     have it resonate with your questions! 
%     build a research program/identity. currently my identity is too quixotic and erratic.
